Explanation and enquiry for some parts of EMN(bAbI).py:

Line 3: import torchtext.legacy.datasets instead of torchtext.dataset because the newer PyTorch version requires to do so.
        NOTE: the bAbI dataset were introduced as a built in custom dataset in PyTorch only recently.
              previously, the datasets needed to be initialized on your own.
              
In forward functions, the reshape method is called to reshape the tensor into appropriate size to perform matrix multiplication

Line 94: torch.max is used to obtain one value,
         the value is then multiply with the vocab (V)
         torch.round is to round off the result obtained
         
Line 104: the if statement is used because the anomaly in the dataset where the last batch have different size from the rest of the batches. Hence, I opted to exclude it from the training loop

Line 112: the output and target for loss function needed to be in dtype=float
          since the answer are in batches, answer[i] is used to calculate the loss for each
